## [Unreleased]

### üöÄ Features
- Added a configurable AI model selector for quests and task investigations, exposing OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepSeek options in the UI with tooltips and persisting the chosen model per record.
- Worker now routes jobs to provider-specific APIs (with automatic fallback) using the shared model catalog that can be overridden via `AI_MODEL_CONFIG_JSON` / `AI_MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` and new `ANTHROPIC_*` / `DEEPSEEK_*` keys.
- Quest owners can now archive or permanently delete quests from list/detail views via a confirmation dialog; new `/api/quests/:id/archive` and DELETE `/api/quests/:id` endpoints enforce ownership, log actions, filter archived data, and update the Prisma schema with a `QuestStatus` enum + `deletedAt` column to keep analytics clean.
- Introduced an authenticated dashboard at `/dashboard` with quest/task metrics, quick links to private and public quests, and login/signup redirects that land users on the new overview. (#82)
- Integrated OAuth authentication with support for Google and Facebook providers:
  - Users can link/reconnect OAuth accounts from the settings page with real-time connection status.
  - OAuth handlers support account creation, sign-in, and linking existing Questify accounts to social providers.
  - Popup-based OAuth flow with automatic session refresh and flash message feedback for success/error states.
  - Backend stores OAuth tokens with automatic refresh and expiry tracking in the database.

### üõ† Fixes
- Ensured Prisma schema + generated client include `modelType` fields and tightened queue payloads so builds/linting succeed across workspaces.
- Fixed test failures for async components (home, dashboard, quests pages) by properly wrapping them in Suspense boundaries and adding comprehensive async handling with `flushPromises()` and `nextTick()`.
- Resolved TypeScript build errors: removed invalid `.value` access on boolean `pending` in quests/[id].vue and fixed read-only property mutations in nuxt.config.ts by using in-place array manipulation.
- Fixed TypeScript and module resolution errors in OAuth handlers (facebook.get.ts, google.get.ts) by removing explicit imports and relying on nuxt-auth-utils auto-imported OAuth event handler functions (`defineOAuthGoogleEventHandler`, `defineOAuthFacebookEventHandler`), which are automatically available in server routes.
- Fixed settings page test by adding proper stubs for VListItem named slots (#prepend, #append) and VListItemTitle/VListItemSubtitle components to ensure buttons render correctly during testing.
- Fixed OAuth refresh token preservation: created `mapTokensForUpdate()` function that only updates refresh tokens when providers supply new ones, preventing loss of stored tokens on subsequent logins (Google and other providers typically omit refresh tokens after the initial authorization).

### üõ† Fixes
- Fixed layout issues in the mobile header menu, ensuring proper visibility and accessibility of actions.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2025-10-25

### üöÄ Features
- Added a mobile header menu that collapses all navigation, theme, admin, and auth actions into an accessible Vuetify dropdown when the viewport is under 768px, keeping controls usable on phones. (#72)
- **Public Quest Sharing** (#46)

### üß™ Tests
- Added a Playwright regression that drives the mobile header menu to ensure the hamburger activator exposes share controls and opens the dialog without reloading. (#72)

### üõ† Fixes
- Removed legacy inline alerts and normalized API error text to avoid leaking HTTP metadata into the UI.

- Added task investigation API endpoint, queue wiring, and worker processing so investigations are enqueued and resolved asynchronously.

### üé® UI

- Surfaced investigation history beneath each task with status badges, timestamps, summaries, and error messaging.

### üß™ Tests & Infrastructure

    - Provides global mocks for Nitro/H3 helpers such as `defineEventHandler` and `getUserSession`.
    - Safely initializes or skips Prisma migrate reset depending on the test mode.
  - Refactored `vitest.config.mts` with a `USE_MOCKS` toggle to support two modes:
    - **Mock Mode (`USE_MOCKS=true`)** ‚Üí routes tested with mocked `PrismaClient` (no database).
    - **Integration Mode (`USE_MOCKS=false`)** ‚Üí runs against a real test database.
  - Added script shortcuts `test:mock` and `test:integration` for quick switching between the two modes.
  - Confirmed that API route tests (e.g., `/api/quests`) execute in a pure Node environment with fast, deterministic results.
